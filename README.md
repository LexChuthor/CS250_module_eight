## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
### I typically interpret user needs by discussing them with the product owner, and then coming up with criteria that indicate a feature or deliverable that meets the user need, and then defining why the user needs that feature.  User stories are useful in this process because they show either the steps to completing that deliverable, or allow you to have the requirements of the feature defined beforehand, with the acceptance criteria also defined.
## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
### I approach developing programs by defining what the program is supposed to do, and then designing the program based on those requirements.  After a basic design that meets the requirements has been completed, my team and I would dive into writing the code of the program.  I hope to incorporate sprint planning and grooming meetings into my future development work, and also daily stand-ups in order to stay accountable and get help when I need it.
## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
### Being a good team member in software development typically means playing your role on the team well.  Although there are several different types of team members, the primary factor in being a good team member is staying accountable to your stories, as well as being a good communicator and facilitator.
